# Project Learning

In this project, we will develop a microservice solution using spring boot and spring cloud similar to the first example of microservices. However this time we will focus more on desgin patterns and software concepts such as:
1. Clean Architecture & Hexagonal Architecture
2. Domain Driven Design
3. CQRS Pattern
4. SAGA and Outbox Patterns


We will also use Docker and K8S and apply clean code principles (discussed in the other directories of this repo) to build an application that meets a real-world use case.
