# Project Learning

In this project, we will develop a microservice solution using spring boot and spring cloud while applying famous spring cloud technologies that are used as microservices patterns such as:

1. Service Discovery
2. Distributed Tracing
3. API Gateway
4. Messages Queues:
	* RabbitMQ
	* Kafka

We will also use Docker and K8S and apply clean code principles (discussed in the other directories of this repo) to build an application that meets a real-world use case.
