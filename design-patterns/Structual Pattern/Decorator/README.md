# Decorator

> **Decorator** is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.



A decorator pattern could be a solution of a class explosion.  If you feel that at one time you are creating multiple subclasses with slight variation inheriting from the class. a decorator pattern could be a solution.
