# CQRS

In this README.md file I will discuss the concepts of CQRS. 

For a coding application refer to: [mediator](https://github.com/RolandSall/Microservices-Concepts/tree/main/design-patterns/Mediator-CQRS/dotnet-core), [axon](https://github.com/RolandSall/Microservices-Concepts/tree/main/event-driven-microservices/java/templates/cqrs-eventsourcing-axon)

Command-Query Responsibility Separation is a pattern that differentiate between commands and queries.


```mermaid
graph LR
A[UI/API] -->C{Type}
    C -->|Command| D[Command Model]
    C -->|Query| E[Projections]
```


Two [models](https://github.com/RolandSall/Microservices-Concepts/tree/main/software-design/DDD) are being used.

* Command Models focuses on executing tasks expressed in operations containing the needed data
* Query Models focus on retrieving data.

## Synchronization of models

The query model should be able to adjust to the different command models that are executed. Multiple solution can be adopted:

*  Shared Data source - (violates microservices patterns)
* Stored Procedure
* Event-Driven Architecture (This is what is being focused on currently)

Hence the commands and query are linked by events to catch any modifications.

#### Examples

> ```mermaid
> graph LR
> A[Product] --> C{Comamnds}
> C --> |Insert Command| ADD[Add Product] --> ADD-EFFECT[Show Product]
> C --> |Update Command| UPDATE[Upadte Product] 
> UPDATE --> UPDATE-EFFECT[Update Shown Product] 
> ```

For Query examples, the concept is more related to the actual data and how different users have access to this data depending on the bounded context.
