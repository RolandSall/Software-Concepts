# Repository Objective

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate software design concepts ranging from principles of writing good codes, to design patterns, up to system design principles.



This repository will be designed into multiple sub-directories that cover a wide variety of subjects that falls under the hat of a good software engineer toolkit.



Topics that are being mainly worked on:

* Design Patterns: Both Theoretical and Practical
* Clean Code Principles & Design: SOLID Principles, Clean Architecture
* Microservices concepts: Gateways, discovery services, and other well-known patterns



These topics are encountered in almost any workplace. This repository aims for the software engineers audience to get a glimpse of how these concepts are necessary for maintain efficiently a working system.



Next topic (if I was to able progress on the latter topics): Devops. For now, try to enjoy the current contents that are constantly being updated. 

I will also be working on a roadmap to better highlight which topic you should tackle first.
