# Repository Objective

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate software design concepts ranging from principles of writing good codes, to design patterns, up to system design principles.



This repository will be designed into multiple sub-directories that covers a wide variety of subjects that falls under the hat of a good software engineer toolkit.



Topics that are being mainly worked on:

* Design Patterns: Both Theoretical and Practical
* Clean Code Principles & Design: SOLID Principles, Clean Architecture
* Microservices concepts: Gateways, discovery services and other well-known patterns



These topics are encountered in almost in workplace. This repository aims to let the software audience to related on how these concepts are necessary for maintaining an efficient and scalable system.



The next topics (if these were able to be well progressed on), is to tackle Devops topics. For now try to enjoy the current contents that is constantly updated. I will also be working on roadmap to better highlight from which topic you should tackle first.
