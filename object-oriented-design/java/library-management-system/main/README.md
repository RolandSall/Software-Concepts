# Problem 

Manage a library system where users can borrow or buy items from the library.
the library system is always updated by new books by the staff.
you can rent a book for a certain period n and you cannot have more than m books rented at the same time
if a user does not return a book a n duration he or she should pay a fine.

if the user have a subscription the fine will be
different then a user has does not have subscription. the fine also depend on the user fine renting history.
If a user get fined more than x amount time he is not allowed to borrow books, he is only allow to buy books.

books also have copies, that are normally kept tracked for. the books are stored on rack to directly identify 
their location.

you can search for a book by its name, category or author name
